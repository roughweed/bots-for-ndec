# bots-for-ndec
This rep is to upload the backup files of NDEC's Discord Bots

As the event for which the bots were made has been over, the bots serve no purpose. Anyone is permitted to download them if needed to modify or use for theirselves.  

Notes:
Token files and database are hidden as they are confidential.
You have to manually input the IDs of the channels and the guild in the .py files.
As it was made for totally internal purpose, comments are not included.
